ols1clk tek tuşla OpenLiteSpeed kurulumu ypaan bir bash scriptidir. Bu script ile OpenLiteSpeed kurulumu kolayca gerçekleştirebilirsiniz.Ayrıca sisteme eklenen **-w** opsiyonu ile wordpress kurulumu da yapabilirsiniz.

An openmysql database can also be set up using this script if needed.

This can be used with **--wpuser**, **--wppassword**, **--wplang**, and **--sitetitle** to configure each of the settings normally set by wp-config.php.
